        <h2>What is Stoicism?</h2>
        <p>
            Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that teaches us to focus on what we can control
            and accept what we cannot. Practiced by emperors, soldiers, writers, and thinkers,
            Stoicism encourages clarity, discipline, and inner peace.
